Getting started with Tarantool Cartridge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we'll walk you through developing a simple cluster-aware application.

The plan is like this:

#. :ref:`Install <getting_started_cartridge_install>` Tarantool Cartridge
   and other components of the development environment.
#. :ref:`Create a project <cartridge-project>`, see what's inside, and
   make a dry run.
#. Develop the application.
   This will be an evergreen "Hello, world!" stub -- just not to overload
   the story with complicated business logic.
#. :ref:`Deploy <cartridge-deploy>` our application to 3 target servers.
#. :ref:`Start the cluster <cartridge-deployment>` and test what we have.
