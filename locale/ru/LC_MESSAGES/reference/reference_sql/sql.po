"CREATE TABLE t (s1 SCALAR PRIMARY KEY);\n"

msgstr ""

"the underlying primitive type of the item in the first row is INTEGER "
"because literal 55 has data type INTEGER, and the underlying primitive "
"type in the second row is STRING (the data type of a literal is always "
"clear from its format)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An item's primitive type is far more important than its defined type. "
"Incidentally Tarantool might find the primitive type by looking at the "
"way MsgPack stores it, but that is an implementation detail."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A SCALAR definition may not include a maximum length, as there is no "
"suggested restriction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A SCALAR definition may include a COLLATE clause, which affects any items"
" whose primitive data type is STRING. The default collation is "
"\"binary\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some assignments are illegal when data types differ, but legal when the "
"target is a SCALAR item. For example ``UPDATE ... SET column1 = 'a'`` is "
"illegal if ``column1`` is defined as INTEGER, but is legal if ``column1``"
" is defined as SCALAR -- values which happen to be INTEGER will be "
"changed so their data type is STRING."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is no literal syntax which implies data type SCALAR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"TYPEOF(x) is never SCALAR, it is always the underlying data type. This is"
" true even if ``x`` is null (in that case the data type is BOOLEAN). In "
"fact there is no function that is guaranteed to return the defined data "
"type. For example, ``TYPEOF(CAST(1 AS SCALAR));`` returns INTEGER, not "
"SCALAR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For any operation that requires implicit casting from an item defined as "
"SCALAR, the syntax is legal but the operation may fail at runtime. At "
"runtime, Tarantool detects the underlying primitive data type and applies"
" the rules for that. For example, if a definition is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CREATE TABLE t (s1 SCALAR PRIMARY KEY, s2 INTEGER);"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"and within any row ``s1 = 'a'``, that is, its underlying primitive type "
"is STRING to indicate character strings, then ``UPDATE t SET s2 = s1;`` "
"is illegal. Tarantool usually does not know that in advance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For any dyadic operation that requires implicit casting for comparison, "
"the syntax is legal and the operation will not fail at runtime. Take this"
" situation: comparison with a primitive type VARBINARY and a primitive "
"type STRING."

"CREATE TABLE t (s1 SCALAR PRIMARY KEY);\n"
"INSERT INTO t VALUES (X'41');\n"
"SELECT * FROM t WHERE s1 > 'a';"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The comparison is valid, because Tarantool knows the ordering of X'41' "
"and 'a' in Tarantool/NoSQL 'scalar'. This would be true even if ``s1`` "
"was not defined as SCALAR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result data type of min/max operation on a column defined as SCALAR "
"is the data type of the minimum/maximum operand, unless the result value "
"is NULL. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CREATE TABLE t (s1 INT, s2 SCALAR PRIMARY KEY);\n"
"INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,X'44'),(2,11),(3,1E4),(4,'a');\n"
"SELECT MIN(s2), HEX(MAX(s2)) FROM t;"

msgid "The result is: ``- - [11, '44',]``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is only possible with Tarantool/NoSQL scalar rules, but ``SELECT "
"SUM(s2)`` would not be legal because addition would in this case require "
"implicit casting from VARBINARY to integer, which is not sensible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result data type of a primitive combination is never SCALAR because "
"we in effect use TYPEOF(item) not the defined data type. (Here we use the"
" word \"combination\" in the way that the standard document uses it for "
"section \"Result of data type combinations\".) Therefore for ``MAX(1E308,"
" 'a', 0, X'00')`` the result is X'00'."
